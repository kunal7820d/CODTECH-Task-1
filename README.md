## Overview of the Project

**Project Name**: Temperature Converter

**Programming Language**: C

**Objective**:
The goal of this project is to develop a temperature conversion program that can convert temperatures between various units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should be able to take user input, perform the necessary conversions, and output the results. This simple project helps demonstrate basic input/output handling, conditionals, functions, and arithmetic operations in C.

**Key Features**:
**User-Friendly Interface**:

The user should be prompted to input the temperature and the desired conversion units.
Clear instructions should be displayed for each conversion option.

**Multiple Conversion Options**:

Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Allow conversion in both directions (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa).
Error Handling:

Check for invalid input and guide the user to correct it (e.g., non-numeric input or invalid unit selection).
